Problems:
# Script will run if you are not a root user
# We need to make the changes/edits from the CLI
# Need to Fetch password and Parse it somewhere else. --> Using variables
# Need to handle errors

ENHANCEMENT:
----------
OUTPUT : We can enhance the output as per the requirements.

*** Redirectors--> Shell Concept ***

STDOUT(> or 1>) ---> Output of the system can be given as an input to the file
STDIN(<)---> Instead of taking input from the keyboard, if we want to send through a file then we use
this redirector. (file's output can be given as input to the command.)
>> --> Append the output to the existing, instead of replacing/rewriting the existing one.
STDERR(2>) --> It will just append only the errors.

# STDOUT(> / 1>) STDERR (&>)
If you want to redirect Standard Output and Standard errors to two different files separately
you have to mention both of them.

# STDOUT& STDERR (&>) --> Both output and error will be redirected to the same file

--> We can store the output in a file for future reference by using the above options.
--> If you don't want any output for future reference you can nullify it using below command
&>/dev/null

# PRINTING THE MESSAGE:
--> echo command will help us printing the message on screen from our scripts
--> While Printing we can enable some esc sequences for more options. They are shown below
--> Quotes are mandatory for using the \esc sequence
1. \e - To enable the color
For colored output Printing :
syntax: echo -e "\e[31mHelloworld\e[0m"
-e --> To enable \e
\e[31m --> 31m is the color code for red
\e[0m --> 0 is to reset the color ( Note: when we enable color its our responsibility to disable it)

*** COLORS CODE ***
31m - RED
32m - GREEN
33m - YELLOW
34m - BLUE
35m - MAGENTA
36m - CYAN

2. \n - Print the new line ( to print the multi line and enable \n we need -e option and see below syntax)
# syntax - echo -e "Hello\nWorld"
3. \t - To Print the tab space
syntax - echo \t "Hello\tworld"

PROBLEM WITH SHELL SCRIPT:
----------
It will not stop the script incase if there are any errors/if a command is failed, it just proceeds by default.
Solution: set -e(option)

UNDERSTANDING:
How set command knew there was an error ?.

*** QUOTES ***
SINGLE QUOTES: Every character will be is considered as normal characters.
DOUBLE QUOTES: very few characters like $ will be considered as a special character and
remaining are considered as normal characters.

*** Variables ***
• If you assign a name to set of data that is called as a variable.
• In Bash shell we declare the variable as --> VAR=DATA
• In Bash Shell we access the variable as --> $VAR or ${VAR}
• All the time we will not hardcode the value of a variable and we need the data dynamically
• COMMAND & ARITHMETIC
Substitution
• VAR=$(command), this is command subst, Command output will go to VAR variable
• VAR=$((expression)), this is arithmetic subst, expression output goes to variable.
Example is $((2+3))
• Variable names can have only characters a-z, A-, 0-9, _(underscore)
• Special characters are not allowed
• A variable should not start with a number and it can start with a Underscore.
• Variables by default will not have any data types.
• Everything is a string.
• As a user you should know that what data would come, since there is no data types.
• In Linux Shell Scripts people from Unix/Linux background considers the variable names will all CAPS. Ex: COURSE_NAME
• People from Java/DEV background prefer CamelCases Variables Ex: courseName / CourseName.
